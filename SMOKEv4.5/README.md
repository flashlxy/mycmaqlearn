## Introduction
The purpose of SMOKE is to convert the resolution of the data in an emission inventory to the resolution needed by an air quality model. Emission inventories typically have an annual-total emissions value for each emissions source, or perhaps an average-day emissions value. The AQMs, however, typically require emissions data on an hourly basis, for each model grid cell(and perhaps model layer), and for each model species. Consequently, to achieve the input requirements of the AQM, emissions processing must(at a minimum) transform inventory data by temporal allocation, chemical speciation, spatial allocation, and perhaps layer assignment.

In addition to changing the resolution of the data, SMOKE must also provide the AQM input files in the correct file format. SMOKE can create the Input/Output Applications Programming Interface(I/O API) Network Common Data Form(NetCDF) output format needed by the CMAQ and MAQSIP models. It can also create the Fortran binary format for the 2-D emissions needed by REMSAD, UAM, and CAMx, and the ASCII elevated-point-source format used by the Ptsrce preprocessor to these models. File format is also important for the input files used by SMOKE, most of which are ASCII files, but some of which are I/O API NetCDF or CF-compliant NetCDF format files.

In this chapter, we introduce you to various concepts that are critical to understanding the technical decription of emissions processing, as well as provide more detail about the processing capabilities of SMOKE. This chapter provides the context and framework for the rest of the user's manual. To assist you in reading and using this chapter, we provide Appendix A. Glossary for definitions of emissions inventory and emissions modeling terminology.

## Assigns file and environment variables

The Assigns file is a script used to set up the parameters of a SMOKE run. The file configures the UNIX environment so that all of the correct input, intermediate, and output directories and files can be identified and used by the SMOKE programs. It also sets things like the name of the grid and the time period that you will run SMOKE for a given case. It does this by setting many UNIX environent variables, explained that SMOKE can be compiled on operating system other than the ones provided with the SMOKE distribution. More information on the Assigns file is provided in Section 4.2.2.2, "Assigns files".

Environment variables are aliases that can be set by a UNIX operating system. These variables are defined during a user's UNIX session, usually defined by an xterm or other UNIX terminal window. The environment variables that SMOKE uses store the input, intermediate, and output files and directories. For example, the environment variable for the directory that is the SMOKE root directory is SMKROOT. At the UNIX prompt, this environment variables could be defined to an actual path such as /home/mylogin/smoke. To set an environment variable, the UNIX setenv command is needed. In this example, the command to define SMKROOT as the given path is :

## setenv SMKROOT /home/mylogin/smoke
